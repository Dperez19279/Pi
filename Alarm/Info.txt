#Pi Alarm
Using a Pi 3, I have created an advanced Alarm Clock.
Some of the abilities of the alarm clock include motion based alarm.
Also the alarm is simplified by reducing the required buttons to two: one for snooze, one for turning it off.
Alarm settings can be accessed by any device on the network via a browser.
It can also be manually configured based via ssh or any file transfer system.
